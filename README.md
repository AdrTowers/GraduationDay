##Intro
<p>Welcome to High School! The next four years will be the most exciting times of your life. Your task is to answer as many questions correctly as you can in order to graduate. You can navigate around the school in order to get to your next class. Beware of the class bully though! They tend to pop up from time to time to steal your work! Go around each classroom and answer the teacherâ€™s question. Just know that if you decide to cheat, you might get caught! Keep a look out in the rooms between classes, you may find some special items. Have fun and may the odds be ever in your favor!!</p>
